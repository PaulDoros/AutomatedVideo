    "script": "1. Hook: Tired of the midnight baby wake-up calls?\n2. Problem/Setup: It's challenging when your baby doesn't sleep through the night, leaving both of you exhausted.\n3.

    "script": "1. Hook: Ever wondered why babies love peekaboo?\n2. Problem/Setup: It's not just a game to them, it's a brain booster!\n3. Solution/Development: Peekaboo teaches babies about object permanence, the concept that objects still exist even when they can't be seen. This game stimulates their memory and helps develop their understanding of the world. Plus, when you reappear with a \"peekaboo!\", it lights up their brain's reward center, encouraging social interaction.\n4. Result/Punchline: So, every \"peekaboo\" is not just fun; it's a step towards their cognitive development.\n5. Call to action: Keep the games going, and watch their little minds grow!",

It\u2019s a phase called separation anxiety.\n3. **Solution/Development:** This is actually a good sign! It means your baby is forming strong attachments. To ease this phase, practice short goodbyes. Leave for a few minutes and gradually increase your time away. Each return reassures your baby that you\u2019ll always come back. Keep your goodbyes consistent and loving but brief.\n4. **Result/Punchline:** Over time, your baby learns you're still there for them, even if they can't see you. This builds trust and security.\n5. **Call to action:** For more baby milestones and how to handle them, hit that subscribe button!\n\n---\n\n**",
