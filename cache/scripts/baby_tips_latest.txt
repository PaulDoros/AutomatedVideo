1. **Hook:** Ever noticed your baby’s sudden clinginess? It’s not just you.
2. **Problem/Setup:** Around 8 months, babies can show signs of anxiety when you leave. It’s a phase called separation anxiety.
3. **Solution/Development:** This is actually a good sign! It means your baby is forming strong attachments. To ease this phase, practice short goodbyes. Leave for a few minutes and gradually increase your time away. Each return reassures your baby that you’ll always come back. Keep your goodbyes consistent and loving but brief.
4. **Result/Punchline:** Over time, your baby learns you're still there for them, even if they can't see you. This builds trust and security.
