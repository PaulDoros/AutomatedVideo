It's like playing hide and seek... except the one hiding is invisible, and the playground is the size of Mars.\"*\n\n**[Setup - 15s]**\n\n\"So, you've been coding for hours, fueled by nothing but coffee and sheer will. Your code finally runs. You're ecstatic, ready to celebrate... until you see it. The dreaded error message. Now, it's time to switch from coder to detective.\"\n\n**[Technical Explanation with Jokes - 25s]**\n\n\"First up, the 'print' statements, the breadcrumbs of the tech world. They're like saying, 'If you're here, blink twice.' Sometimes, they help. Other times, you're just spamming your console, hoping for a miracle.\n\nThen, there's the debugger, the magnifying glass. It promises clarity but often feels like it's magnifying your confusion instead. You step through your code like you're tiptoeing through a minefield, whispering, 'Please don't explode.'\n\nAnd let's not forget the classic: asking a rubber duck for help. Yes, explaining your code to an inanimate object. Because at this point, you're convinced the duck might actually have a degree in computer science.\"\n\n**[Punchline - 10s]**\n\n\"In the end, you find the bug. It was a missing semicolon. A semicolon! So tiny, yet so powerful. Like discovering the villain was the butler all along.\"\n\n**[Call to action - 5s]**\n\n\"Cracked the case? Celebrate by hitting that subscribe button!
