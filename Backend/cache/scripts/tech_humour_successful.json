    "script": "Ever wonder why coffee can make some folks sleepy instead of wired? Here\u2019s the scoop: When caffeine blocks adenosine, your body doesn\u2019t stop producing it. So when the caffeine wears off, there\u2019s a surplus of adenosine that makes you feel even more tired! Next time your coffee seems to backfire with a snooze effect, remember, it\u2019s just your body catching up on its adenosine backup. So, maybe grab a water instead of a second cup! Stay alert out there!",
